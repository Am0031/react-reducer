# React-Reducer

This project is an introduction to the react hook useReducer. It follows our practice with useState and useEffect hooks.
It is the illustration code for the hashnode blog article ["Using the react useReducer hook with an API call"](https://fullstackjslearning.hashnode.dev/using-react-usereducer-hook-with-an-api-call). This article is part #3 of a 7-part series on React hooks.
