This project is an introduction to the react hook useReducer. It is part of our practice with React hooks:

- part#2 - useEffect
- part#3 - useReducer

It is the illustration code for the hashnode blog article ["Using the react useReducer hook with an API call"](https://fullstackjslearning.hashnode.dev/using-react-usereducer-hook-with-an-api-call). This article is part #3 of a 7-part series of articles on React hooks.
